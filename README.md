# Octaver-Master-Project
A real-time Octaver audio plugin inspired by the Ocean algorithm [1] in the frequency domain, implemented with the more efficient sliding DFT method.

Test bench for the original algorithm is presented in "OceanTestBenchPlugin.m" file.
To run it, download the project, open the file in Matlab and use the command line tool "AudioTestBench" to open it as such:
"AudioTestBench(OceanTestBenchPlugin)".
